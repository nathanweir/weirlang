⚠️ Heads-up: this repo is entirely Claude Code generated. It's a toy personal project that, while amusing, probably shouldn't be used in any serious capacity by anyone.

This project is an attempt at very aggressively pushing Claude Code to its limits by designing & building an entire programming language, affectionately named simply `weir`. This is admittedly a bespoke, personal ecosystem that combines a number of fun ideas which I hope can together serve as a seriously un-serious local tool for me to do indie game development. That is, the weir lang is specifically written for small-scale game dev scenarios. It's a little more intentional than vibe coding but also much less than if this was aimed at being a widely accepted, shared ecosystem by other devs.

TBD outline the major features of this language when having Claude write docs.
