description: Building and linking native C libraries with Weir packages.

Weir packages can include native C source files that are automatically compiled and linked.

## Quick Reference

In `weir.pkg`, declare native sources and link libraries:

```lisp
(package
  (name "weir-gl")
  (version "0.1.0")
  (sources "lib.weir")
  (native
    (sources "gl_helper.c")
    (link "glfw" "GL" "m")))
```

- **JIT mode**: C sources compiled to `.so`, loaded via `dlopen`
- **AOT mode**: C sources passed to the system linker
- Use `--load` flag to manually pre-load shared libraries in JIT mode
