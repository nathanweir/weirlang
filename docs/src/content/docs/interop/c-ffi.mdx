description: Calling C libraries from Weir via extern "C" declarations.

Weir can call C functions directly using `extern "C"` declarations, with safety enforced via `unsafe` blocks.

## Quick Reference

```lisp
;; Declare external C functions
(extern "C"
  (defn abs ((n : i32)) : i32)
  (defn SDL_Init ((flags : u32)) : i32))

;; Must use unsafe to call them
(unsafe
  (println (abs -42)))
```

- **`Ty::Ptr`** — raw pointer type for FFI, represented as `i64`
- **JIT**: symbols resolved via `dlsym` at runtime
- **AOT**: linked via `cc` with `-l` flags
- **Interpreter**: dynamic calls via `libffi`
