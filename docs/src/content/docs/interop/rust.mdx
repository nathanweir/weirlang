Weir's runtime, standard library, and compiler are implemented in Rust. Safe Rust functions are exposed to Weir code without requiring `unsafe`.

## Quick Reference

The standard library and runtime are Rust-implemented. Functions like `println`, `str`, `len`, and math operations are Rust functions linked into the runtime. They don't require `unsafe` — the Rust compiler already enforces safety.

```lisp
;; These are safe — implemented in Rust
(println "Hello")
(let ((v [1 2 3]))
  (println (len v)))
```

Only `extern "C"` functions (external C libraries) require `unsafe` blocks.
