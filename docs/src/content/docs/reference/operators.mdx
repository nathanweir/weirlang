description: Operator precedence and evaluation order in Weir.

Weir uses prefix notation — there is no operator precedence in the traditional sense.

## Overview

Since Weir uses S-expression syntax, all operations are explicit function calls with parenthesized prefix notation:

```lisp
(+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))    ;; 2*3 + 4*5 = 26
```

There is no ambiguity — the nesting of parentheses fully determines evaluation order. Operator precedence rules from infix languages do not apply.

The built-in operators are: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`, `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `not`, `and`, `or`.
