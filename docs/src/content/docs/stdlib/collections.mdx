## Quick Reference

### Vectors

```lisp
[1 2 3 4 5]                     ;; vector literal
(len [1 2 3])                    ;; => 3
(nth [10 20 30] 1)               ;; => 20
(append [1 2] 3)                 ;; => [1 2 3]
(set-nth [1 2 3] 1 99)           ;; => [1 99 3]
```

### Hash-Maps

```lisp
{:name "Alice" :health 100}     ;; map literal
(len {:a 1 :b 2})                ;; => 2
```
