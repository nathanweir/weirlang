description: Hygienic, purely syntactic macros in Weir.

Weir's macro system is purely syntactic — macros transform S-expressions into S-expressions without type knowledge. They are hygienic by default.

## Quick Reference

Macros operate in the pipeline as: `parse → macro expand → type check → compile`

Key properties:
- **Purely syntactic** — transform S-expressions without querying types
- **Hygienic by default** — no accidental variable capture
- **Can generate types** — macros can emit `deftype`, `defstruct`, and `instance` forms
- **Cascade-aware** — macro redefinition triggers re-expansion of all call sites

```lisp
(defmacro defsystem (name component-type &body body)
  `(defn ,name ((entities : (List ,component-type))) : Unit
     (for-each entities (fn (e) ,@body))))
```

Use `weir expand` to inspect macro output.
