Weir provides several control flow forms: `if`, `cond`, `match`, `when`, and `unless`.

## Quick Reference

- **`if`** — Binary conditional. Else branch required when result is used.
- **`cond`** — Multi-branch conditional with required `else`.
- **`match`** — Pattern matching with exhaustiveness checking.
- **`when` / `unless`** — Single-branch side-effecting forms (return `Unit`).
- **`do`** — Explicit sequencing block for multi-expression positions.

```lisp
(if (> x 0) "positive" "non-positive")

(cond
  ((< health 0) (die))
  ((< health 20) (flee))
  (else (attack)))

(when (key-pressed? :escape)
  (open-menu)
  (pause-game))
```
